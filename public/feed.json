Many users write their complete FAQ content in intents and responses. You no longer need a developer to tweak your conversations or deploy your agent which makes it very scalable for large organizations. It’s also possible to load data from external systems. In that case, you are hosting parts of the conversation elsewhere. You could store these parts in language files or databases. Some organizations prefer to write the full conversation in the Dialogflow UI. That way your copywriters can maintain the full conversation. It’s good to know that it is possible to use templates and conditionals within the Dialogflow UI. The trick here, is to make use of the custom payload response setting, which you can find in the Intent &gt; Responses section.","pubDate":"Sun, 20 May 2018 15:02:22 GMT","guid":"https://www.leeboonstra.com/Bots/conditional-templating-in-dialogflow-for-google-assistant/","category":"Bots"},{"title":"Custom greeting Google Assistant app with Dialogflow and Actions on Google","link":"https://www.leeboonstra.com/Bots/custom-greeting-google-assistant-app-with-dialogflow-and-actions-on-google/","description":"Let’s have a look into how you can create custom dynamic Welcome messages for your Google Assistant with Dialogflow and Actions on Google.","pubDate":"Sun, 20 May 2018 06:20:08 GMT","guid":"https://www.leeboonstra.com/Bots/custom-greeting-google-assistant-app-with-dialogflow-and-actions-on-google/","category":"Bots"},{"title":"Actions on Google with Google Cloud Functions","link":"https://www.leeboonstra.com/Bots/actions-on-google-for-google-cloud-functions/","description":"When building Google Assistant apps (actions) with Dialogflow, you likely will have to write some logics.

Wednesday the 15th of March 2017, was a big day for the Netherlands, at that day it was the Dutch general election, where the Dutch elected members of the house of representatives. The House of Representatives (the Second Chamber) is composed of 150 seats elected by proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency. There are 28 political parties, where the Dutch can vote the members from. Since I recently started working with Google Cloud Platform, I thought it would be a great idea, to predict the winning political party based on social media presence and sentiment.
