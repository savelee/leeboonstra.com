Ever had to reskin UI components to match a visual design or brand standard? The new Themes feature in Architect 3 makes changing the look and feel of your app easier than ever.
<!--more-->

If you’re familiar with Sass/SCSS, you’ll find this new feature a huge time saver. Architect 3 now allows you to locate and change the different variables and rules that define the visual appearance of the UI components in Ext JS and Sencha Touch.

In this one-hour webinar, Lee Boonstra, Sencha Trainer & Theming Expert, will show you how to:

Load a template and modify it
Customize the look and feel of an app, and see the changes in Architect
Export your template for use on Sencha Market or in other applications

Some working knowledge or experience with Sass/SCSS is recommended, but not required.
