A few weeks ago I recorded a (Dutch) video/webinar together with [Allianz](https://samen.allianz.nl/voice-en-verzekeringen/) for the insurance world (insurers and advisors), to explain what Conversational could do for your organization. A talk about chatbots, Google Assistant & bots in the contact center.
