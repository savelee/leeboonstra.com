Summer 2017, I run a technical session about G Suite at Google Cloud Next, in Amsterdam. This session is a G Suite technical talk on how companies can extend on top of G Suite, whether it is on organization's own application or whether they want to write a code on top of G Suite. The talk is followed by a live use case with CEO and Founder of VOGSY, Leo Koster. Enjoy watching!
