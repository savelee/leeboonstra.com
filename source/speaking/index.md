    Presentation: Let's talk about enterprise apps! Often those apps don’t live in an app store. They live in a private cloud or private network. Maybe even secured and behind a firewall. You and I, might not even be aware of these types of apps. You need to have experience, with building complex applications like these. But that’s difficult, if you don’t really see these apps in the wild. In this session, Lee Boonstra will discuss why enterprise apps can be complex, and how you can build better apps, with maintainability and scalability in mind!
