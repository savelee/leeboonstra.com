* [Here's my resume: Lee Boonstra CV](/images/lee.boonstra-resume.pdf)




I’m [Lee Boonstra](https://plus.google.com/117712452932146916020) from Amsterdam, the Netherlands and I'm a Googler. I work as a sales engineer in the Google Cloud team where I assist the sales team with technical knowledge about cloud computing and machine learning for the financial industry.

I studied Art & Technology in 2004 and during my last year of my study I worked for Accenture as a senior Java developer. I worked for clients such as UPC and KLM (Dutch Royal Airlines). Started my own webdev company when I was 19 years old.

Although I really liked it, after 3 years I decided to make the move to the front-end. I think it’s advantageous to understand back-end technologies while working on the front-end. I’m a creative person and I like to have a nice workflow and see my changes directly on the screen. That’s why I've worked as a teamlead at a creative agency in the Netherlands where we created (mobile) websites and apps for clients such as *Heineken* and *Philips*.

Before Google, I've worked for Sencha. First as, a technical trainer, teaching Ext JS, Sencha Touch, JavaScript and mobile app development to enterprises all over the world.
Afterwards as a Sales engineer & Developer evangelist for EMEA. Also I wrote a book for O'Reilly about Sencha Touch and occasionally I’m doing book reviews about Sencha Technologies.
