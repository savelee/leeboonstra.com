## What is a Developer Advocate?

**TL;DR: A developer advocate is a developer’s best friend!**

A Developer Advocate's role is to act as a bridge between the engineering team and the developer community. Their job is to give feedback to both parties, equally, in both ways. 

Also, a Developer Advocate is an engineer who has good communication and community-building skills.  The responsibilities of the role typically are some or all of the following: public speaking, writing public open source code, writing articles and creating (video) content.

With other words; A Developer Advocate is someone who truly advocates for developers, not just a platform.
