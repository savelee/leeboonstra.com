> “I love creating technology, instead of just consuming technology.”

I’m [Lee Boonstra](https://plus.google.com/117712452932146916020) from the Netherlands and I work for Google. as a Google Cloud sales engineer.

I studied Art & Technology in 2004 and during my last year of my study I worked for Accenture as a senior Java developer. I worked for clients such as UPC and KLM (Dutch Royal Airlines).

Although I really liked it, after 3 years I decided to make the move to the front-end. I think it’s advantageous to understand back-end technologies while working on the front-end. I’m a creative person and I like to have a nice workflow and see my changes directly on the screen. That’s why I worked before Sencha, as a teamlead at a creative agency in the Netherlands where we created (mobile) websites and apps for clients such as Heineken and Philips.

Started my own webdev company when I was 19 years old. It was called: "Ladysign" (Why that name? When you would pronounce this in Dutch it sounds like: "Lee Design").

I love technology. Especially Web. - JavaScript, Node JS, Ext JS, Sencha Touch, Google Cloud, App Engine, API.AI MongoDB, Angular2, HTML5, Sass, CSS, Python, Django, Cordova ...)

Also I wrote a book for O'Reilly about Sencha Touch and occasionally I’m doing book reviews about Sencha Technologies.

Beside technology I love (alternative) music and I’m a videogames addict.
