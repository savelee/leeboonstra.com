A while ago I recorded this great webinar for Sencha. Just in case you missed it; you can watch it back! Building a great looking universal application is more than just responsive design. Developers and designers need to consider how to achieve the best user experience for each device type. Join us in our upcoming webinar as we share a real world example of a great looking universal application for playing music that was built by Lee Boonstra, an engineer at Sencha, using Ext JS 6. In this session, you will learn: -Key principles for building and designing universal apps -How to organize your project including folder structures and MVVM patterns, theming, and reusable custom component packages -How to efficiently build and deploy your application -Why many open source solutions fall short â€“ especially for enterprise grade apps \[https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/11505/172461?utm\_campaign=webcasts-search-results-feed&utm\_content=lee+boonstra&utm\_source=brighttalk-portal&utm\_medium=web&utm\_term=\](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/11505/172461?utm\_campaign=webcasts-search-results-feed&utm\_content=lee+boonstra&utm\_source=brighttalk-portal&utm\_medium=web&utm\_term=)
