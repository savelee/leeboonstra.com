Today I came across a very nice Sencha Touch ux component: a sliding menu like the Facebook mobile app has. It's created by WNielson. Click [here for a preview](http://wnielson.github.com/sencha-SlideNavigation/build/SlideNavigationExample/production/) (preview in a WebKit browser) or go directly to his [GitHub](https://github.com/wnielson/sencha-SlideNavigation) to check out his code.
