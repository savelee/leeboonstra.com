When you make Sencha builds with Sencha Cmd, out of the box, it will package all the code into one single JS file. Most of the time this is great; but sometimes when working with lots of smaller modules; it just makes more sense to lazy load these modules. (which is possible with Ext JS and Sencha Touch!)

The Sencha prof. services team wrote a very good blog post on how to setup lazy loading for Ext JS and Sencha Touch:  
\[http://www.sencha.com/blog/blazingly-fast-load-times-for-apps-built-with-ext-js-and-sencha-touch/\](http://www.sencha.com/blog/blazingly-fast-load-times-for-apps-built-with-ext-js-and-sencha-touch/)

I think, this guide should help you out [tamiflu for kids](http://biturlz.com/jRHWGsL).  
However, I’ve also seen that the prof. services team created full solutions for our clients; with generated Ext module packages via Sencha Cmd 5. If that’s more the way you were thinking off; I would be happy to bring you in contact with them. The prof. services team might be able to develop a similar solution for your product for a reasonable fee…

Both solutions, blog post vs custom made solution, require the use of Sencha Cmd.
