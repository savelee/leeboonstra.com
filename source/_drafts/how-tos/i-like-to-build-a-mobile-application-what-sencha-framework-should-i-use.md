With Ext JS 6, you will be able to build a mobile application. Ext JS 6 is a JavaScript framework based on HTML5 for building cross-platform mobile web applications targeting desktop, tablets, and smartphones. To build a mobile application, you could make use of the Ext JS 6 modern toolkit. This toolkit contains components which are similar to native touch controls. Sencha delivers Stylesheets for iOS, Windows Phone and Android (Material Design), to make your application look like a native app. You can download our trial version of the framework from here: https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/evaluate/ And here are some handy getting started materials: * http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.0-modern/ * http://examples.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.0-ea/examples/kitchensink/?profile=material * http://examples.sencha.com/extjs/6.0.0/examples/kitchensink/?profile=cupertino * http://se.sencha.com/getting-started/ * https://www.sencha.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-a-sencha-touch-app-to-ext-js-6-modern-toolkit-part-1/ * https://www.sencha.com/blog/how-to-build-a-great-looking-universal-app-with-ext-js-part-1/
