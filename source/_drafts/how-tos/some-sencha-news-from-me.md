Hi guys, I just wanted to share some personal Sencha updates with you! **Hands-on Sencha Touch 2 - O'Reilly**  
First of all, my book "Hands-on Sencha Touch" is finally printed. I spent a lot of time, discussing the latest Sencha Touch framework and with this book it's possible to build mobile web applications. Checkout the table of contents at: [http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030058.do](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030058.do) If you like my writing style. I am developing ideas for writing an advanced Ext JS 5 book! **Ext JS 5 courses**  
Talking about Ext JS 5, the new Sencha Ext JS framework... I've been very busy lately, developing course materials for various Ext JS 5 beginners & advanced courses. Learn Ext JS 5, the new MVVM application architecture (viewcontrollers + databinding woot woot!), how to upgrade to Ext JS 5 or how to develop huge enterprise apps for tablets with Ext JS version 5. Checkout our training schedule: [http://www.sencha.com/training/](http://www.sencha.com/training/ "http://www.sencha.com/training/") I will be teaching across all over Europe the next coming months: London, Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, Milan, Zurich, Amsterdam and of course Live Online! Interested? Leave a comment below, and I can give your some discount promo codes! **Conferences & Workshops**
