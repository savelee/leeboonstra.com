Operating System
----------------

In theory, every desktop OS. - but itâ€™s probably best to look which operation systems are supported by Sencha Cmd, since this one has an installer. (Mac OS X, Win 32, Win64, Linux 32) [https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/)

Not mentioned, but it's supported for Sencha Touch, hence why I think it's included in Modern Toolkit mobiles as well:
