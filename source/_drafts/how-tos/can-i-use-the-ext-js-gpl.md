[Ext JS GPL](https://www.sencha.com/legal/GPL/) GPL is opensource. You will have to share all your source code public and with Sencha.

*   You can't use GPL for commercial software.
*   You can't build your project with GPL and later change the license, the project needs to be created with the correct license from the start.
*   Sencha Architect won't work with GPL

See: [https://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/](https://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/) Also, according to Apple AppStore rules, you are not allowed to add GPL projects to their stores.
