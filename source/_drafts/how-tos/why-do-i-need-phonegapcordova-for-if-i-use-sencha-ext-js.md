Sencha applications are (mobile) web applications. They run in a (modern) browser. However, if you want to sell your application as a native application in an App Store, (or you want to make use of native API features), then you can package your application with Cordova or PhoneGap. (Itâ€™s a native wrapper, like a browser, with your web app running inside of it). In case you are curious take a look into my weblog. I wrote a couple of tutorials about Sencha Touch in combination with Cordova / PhoneGap. \[http://www.devtricks.eu/?s=cordova#\](http://www.devtricks.eu/?s=cordova#)
