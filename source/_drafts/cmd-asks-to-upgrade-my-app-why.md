The \`sencha app upgrade\` command, is required to upgrade the current version of your app, to match with the current version of Sencha Cmd you are using. Often, when you generate an application with Cmd, and later upgrade the version of the command-line tool, the meta-data of your app is outdated. Hence why you need to upgrade the app.
