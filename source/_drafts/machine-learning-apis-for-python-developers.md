A couple of months ago, me and my co-worker [@dnovakovskiy](https://twitter.com/dnovakovskiy) spoke on a Python event in the North of the Netherlands: Pygrunn. I forgot that there were recordings made,and came by it today. What a nice surprise! So in case you are a Python dev, here you can see a video of our keynote: Machine Learning APIs for Python Developers. \[embed\]https://youtu.be/-IT9WlCb5uo\[/embed\]
