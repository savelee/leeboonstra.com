When you started your Ext JS 4.* project with Sencha Cmd you know how easy it works to startup and scaffold. It's also easy to upgrade your application to the latest Ext JS 4.2 build. [Download Ext JS 4.2](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/download/) Unpack the folder, open your console and navigate to your Ext JS app. Enter the following command to upgrade:

sencha app upgrade ../downloads/ext4.2

(the last path points to your unpacked folder of extjs4.2) And that's it!
