There you go. I installed Mac OSX Lion and iOS5 on my developer iphone.

I migrated to a new XCode 4.2 project and build my app. Everything works.. till I tried to send it to itunesconnect via the new Application Loader:  
Error: ?There is no embedded Java executable. Please reinstall the Xcode developer tools.?

Solution? Rollback to Application Loader 1.3 again.  
You can download it here: http://itunesconnect.apple.com/apploader/ApplicationLoader_1.3.dmg
