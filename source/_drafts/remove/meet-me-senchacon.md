If you would like to speak in person with me about Sencha Touch or other (Sencha) technologies, I will be at SenchaCon in Orlando Florida (Disney World), this year. SenchCon is the HTML5 event of the year, with over 60 sessions about the Sencha tools and frameworks, a Hackaton and a Sencha Touch bootcamp! Take a look into the [Session Schedule](http://senchacon.com/session-schedule.php), SenchaCon 2013 will be awesome!. [http://senchacon.com](http://senchacon.com).
