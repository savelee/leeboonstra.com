Are you as excited as I am for [Sencha 2015](http://www.senchacon.com/)? On April 7-9 in the heart of Silicon Valley at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Sencha is organising a huge developer conference. It’s going to be three days jam packed with nearly 50 technical sessions led by Sencha engineers, partners and key customers. You’ll learn about HTML5, best practices for building modern web applications and the latest innovations in Sencha Ext JS, GXT, and Touch frameworks. SenchaCon will be also the moment, you can hangout with the engineers and ask me or my co-workers lots of questions about the frameworks. You can find me in the community pavilion! What else? I can tell you that we are currently preparing awesome bootcamps to learn Ext JS and GXT (for beginners and advanced devs!). And there will be great presentations in the tracks (DESIGN, DEVELOP & DEPLOY) and exiting announcements revealed! I will be speaking as well: Advanced theming techniques for Sencha Ext JS using Sencha Cmd. A master class about making your apps look good. I will give answers to the most common questions about theming! Aside from all this great informational and educational stuff, there will be also lots of fun! Every night drinks and parties. Like a big party at the Levi’s Stadium (home of the San Francisco 49ers and Super Bowl 50) and get up-close and personal with behind-the-scenes tours! That's gonna be awesome!
