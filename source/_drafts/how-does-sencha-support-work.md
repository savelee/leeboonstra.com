Sencha sells licenses from up to five seats. These are standard, pro or premium licenses. The standard license contains just the framework, where pro and premium, contain the framework and more development tools. You buy the license once, and you can build unlimited applications with that. With the all the 3 license tiers, it also includes 1 year support. - After the end of the year you can decide to renew the yearly support contract. With Sencha support, you will have access to our support portal, which contains download links to all our frameworks and tools you have access to. Even nightly builds, previous or newer framework/tools versions. The support portal is also the place where you can submit problems or ask questions. By default you will get 40 x-credits per year. When you use your x-credits on a problem, that has been a bug in the framework, you will get your credits back. We have an SLA, we will respond within 24 hours. It also includes access to the premium forums, where you can ask questions. Our (support) engineers are active on the premium forums. -- Only the support contract, needs to be renewed every year. When you don't support the support contract, you are still allowed to build applications with the license, however, you can't get access to newer Ext JS versions and fixes. Let's say, you purchase Ext JS 6 now. - and after a year you won't renew. In two years, we might have released Ext JS 8. You are still allowed to build Ext JS 6 applications, but to build Ext JS 8 apps, you will have to buy the license again. Where maintenance renewal cost a lot less each year: For standard license: $1,395; Pro: $2,194, Premium: $3,240.
